# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
To create a web app that scrapes Latest Mars News, a Featured Mars Image, a Mars Facts table in addition to Mars Hemisphere images from https://data-class-mars.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html, https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html, https://data-class-mars-facts.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars_Facts/index.html and https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars websites respectively. This was accomplished by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images and datato be stored on a Mongo database. Then to ensure the app is polished a web application was used to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to create the finished product:
